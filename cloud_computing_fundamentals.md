Cloud Computing Fundamentals
=========================

Introduction to Cloud Computing
----------------------------

* Definition of cloud computing: Cloud computing is a model for delivering computing services over the internet, where resources such as servers, storage, databases, software, and applications are provided as a service to users.
* Brief history of cloud computing: The concept of cloud computing dates back to the 1960s, but it wasn't until the late 2000s that cloud computing became a mainstream technology. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was launched in 2006, and since then, cloud computing has grown exponentially.
* Types of cloud computing:
	+ Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): provides users with virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking. Users have full control over the infrastructure and are responsible for managing it. Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.
	+ Platform as a Service (PaaS): provides users with a complete platform for developing, running, and managing applications. It includes the operating system, middleware, and development tools. Users do not have to manage the underlying infrastructure. Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
	+ Software as a Service (SaaS): provides users with software applications over the internet. Users do not have to install, configure, or maintain any software, as everything is managed by the provider. Examples: Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, Google Workspace.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Cloud Computing
--------------------------------------------

Advantages:

* Scalability: Cloud computing resources can be scaled up or down as needed, making it easier to adapt to changing business needs.
* Flexibility: Cloud computing allows users to access their data and applications from anywhere, at any time, using any device with an internet connection.
* Cost-effectiveness: Cloud computing eliminates the need for upfront capital expenditures for hardware and infrastructure, as users only pay for the resources they use.
* Reliability: Cloud computing providers offer reliable and redundant infrastructure, ensuring high uptime and availability for applications and data.
* Security: Cloud computing providers offer advanced security measures, such as encryption, firewalls, and access controls, to protect data and applications.

Disadvantages:

* Dependence on internet connectivity: Cloud computing requires a stable and fast internet connection, which can be a problem in areas with poor internet connectivity.
* Potential security risks: Cloud computing environments can be vulnerable to security breaches, data leaks, and other security threats if not properly configured and managed.
* Vendor lock-in: Users may be tied to a specific cloud provider, making it difficult to switch providers if needed.
* Data privacy concerns: Cloud computing raises concerns about data privacy, as data is stored and processed outside the user's premises.

Cloud Service Models
--------------------

* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): provides users with virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking. Users have full control over the infrastructure and are responsible for managing it. Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.
* Platform as a Service (PaaS): provides users with a complete platform for developing, running, and managing applications. It includes the operating system, middleware, and development tools. Users do not have to manage the underlying infrastructure. Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
* Software as a Service (SaaS): provides users with software applications over the internet. Users do not have to install, configure, or maintain any software, as everything is managed by the provider. Examples: Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, Google Workspace.

Cloud Deployment Models
----------------------

* Public cloud: A third-party provider delivers cloud services to multiple customers over the internet. Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.
* Private cloud: A single organization owns and operates the cloud infrastructure, typically within its premises or in a third-party data center.
* Hybrid cloud: A combination of public and private clouds, where workloads can move between environments as needed.

Cloud Security Threats
--------------------

* Unauthorized access: Unauthorized users gaining access to cloud resources.
* Data breaches: Theft or loss of sensitive data, such as personal information or intellectual property.
* Malware and ransomware attacks: Malicious software that encrypts data and demands payment for the decryption key.
* Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks: Overwhelming cloud resources with traffic to make them unavailable to users.

Cloud Security Measures
----------------------

* Access control: Restricting access to cloud resources using authentication, authorization, and identity management.
* Encryption: Protecting data in transit and at rest using encryption algorithms, such as AES.
* Identity and authentication: Verifying user identities and managing access to cloud resources.

Compliance and Regulatory Requirements
--------------------------------------

* HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): Regulations for protecting sensitive healthcare data.
* PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): Standards for protecting payment card data.
* GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): A regulation for protecting personal data of EU citizens.

Cloud Infrastructure
-------------------

* Virtualization technology:
	+ Virtual machines: Virtualized computing resources that mimic physical servers.
	+ Containers: Lightweight, portable environments for applications, isolating them from the underlying infrastructure.
* Cloud storage:
	+ Object storage: Storing data as objects, such as files or images, with metadata and unique identifiers.
	+ Block storage: Storing data as blocks, such as hard disk drives, with fixed sizes and formats.
	+ File storage: Storing data as files, such as documents or spreadsheets, with hierarchical structures.
* Cloud networking:
	+ Virtual private networks (VPNs): Secure, encrypted connections between cloud resources and on-premises infrastructure.
	+ Software-defined networking (SDN): Programmable networks that separate the control plane from the data plane.
