Sure, here are some handouts that you can use to teach cloud computing fundamentals:

1. Introduction to Cloud Computing:
	* Definition of cloud computing: Cloud computing is a model for delivering computing services over the internet, where resources such as servers, storage, databases, software, and applications are provided as a service to users.
	* Brief history of cloud computing: The concept of cloud computing dates back to the 1960s, but it wasn't until the late 2000s that cloud computing became a mainstream technology. Amazon Web Services (AWS) was launched in 2006, and since then, cloud computing has grown exponentially.
	* Types of cloud computing:
		+ Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): provides users with virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking. Users have full control over the infrastructure and are responsible for managing it. Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.
		+ Platform as a Service (PaaS): provides users with a complete platform for developing, running, and managing applications. It includes the operating system, middleware, and development tools. Users do not have to manage the underlying infrastructure. Examples: Heroku, Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
		+ Software as a Service (SaaS): provides users with software applications over the internet. Users do not have to install, configure, or maintain any software, as everything is managed by the provider. Examples: Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, Google Workspace.
	* Advantages and disadvantages of cloud computing:
		+ Advantages: scalability, flexibility, cost-effectiveness, reliability, security, and fast deployment.
		+ Disadvantages: dependence on internet connectivity, potential security risks, vendor lock-in, and data privacy concerns.
2. Cloud Computing Architecture:
	* Cloud service models:
		+ IaaS: users manage the infrastructure, including virtual machines, storage, and networking.
		+ PaaS: users manage the application and data, while the provider manages the infrastructure and middleware.
		+ SaaS: users access software applications over the internet, and the provider manages everything else.
	* Cloud deployment models:
		+ Public cloud: a third-party provider delivers cloud services to multiple customers over the internet. Examples: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.
		+ Private cloud: a single organization owns and operates the cloud infrastructure, typically within its premises or in a third-party data center.
		+ Hybrid cloud: a combination of public and private clouds, where workloads can move between environments as needed.
	* Cloud service providers:
		+ Amazon Web Services (AWS): the largest and most popular cloud provider, offering a wide range of services.
		+ Microsoft Azure: a close second to AWS, offering a similar set of services, including AI and machine learning.
		+ Google Cloud Platform (GCP): a growing cloud provider, known for its focus on AI, machine learning, and data analytics.
3. Cloud Security:
	* Security threats in cloud computing:
		+ Unauthorized access: unauthorized users gaining access to cloud resources.
		+ Data breaches: theft or loss of sensitive data, such as personal information or intellectual property.
		+ Malware and ransomware attacks: malicious software that encrypts data and demands payment for the decryption key.
		+ Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks: overwhelming cloud resources with traffic to make them unavailable to users.
	* Security measures:
		+ Access control: restricting access to cloud resources using authentication, authorization, and identity management.
		+ Encryption: protecting data in transit and at rest using encryption algorithms, such as AES.
		+ Identity and authentication: verifying user identities and managing access to cloud resources.
	* Compliance and regulatory requirements:
		+ HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): regulations for protecting sensitive healthcare data.
		+ PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard): standards for protecting payment card data.
		+ GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): a regulation for protecting personal data of EU citizens.
4. Cloud Infrastructure:
	* Virtualization technology:
		+ Virtual machines: virtualized computing resources that mimic physical servers.
		+ Containers: lightweight, portable environments for applications, isolating them from the underlying infrastructure.
	* Cloud storage:
		+ Object storage: storing data as objects, such as files or images, with metadata and unique identifiers.
		+ Block storage: storing data as blocks, such as hard disk drives, with fixed sizes and formats.
		+ File storage: storing data as files, such as documents or spreadsheets, with hierarchical structures.
	* Cloud networking:
		+ Virtual private networks (VPNs): secure, encrypted connections between cloud resources and on-premises infrastructure.
		+ Software-defined networking (SDN): programmable networks that separate the control plane from the data plane.
5. Cloud Management:
	* Cloud monitoring and logging: monitoring cloud resources and logging events for troubleshooting, auditing, and compliance.
	* Cloud automation and orchestration:
		+ Infrastructure as Code (IaC): managing cloud infrastructure using code, such as AWS CloudFormation or Terraform.
		+ Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): automating the build, test, and deployment of applications.
	* Cloud cost optimization:
		+ Cost estimation: predicting the cost of cloud resources before provisioning.
		+ Cost allocation: tracking and assigning costs to different departments, projects, or users.
		+ Cost optimization strategies: rightsizing instances, using reserved instances, spot instances, and auto-scaling.
6. Cloud Security and Compliance:
	* Cloud security threats and vulnerabilities:
		+ Unsecured interfaces: unprotected APIs, databases, or storage buckets.
		+ Misconfigured resources: misconfigured cloud resources, such as publicly accessible storage buckets.
		+ Unpatched vulnerabilities: unpatched software vulnerabilities, such as outdated operating systems or applications.
	* Cloud security controls and countermeasures:
		+ Identity and access management: restricting access to cloud resources using authentication, authorization, and identity management.
		+ Encryption: protecting data in transit and at rest using encryption algorithms, such as AES.
		+ Network security: securing cloud networks using firewalls, security groups, and network access control lists.
	* Compliance and regulatory requirements:
		+ Data privacy: protecting sensitive data, such as personal information or intellectual property.
		+ Data residency: ensuring data is stored in a specific geography or region, such as the EU or US.
		+ Data sovereignty: ensuring data is controlled and managed by the organization, rather than a third-party provider.
